# Diagrammatic intensities: modelling methods in digital humanities
This paper concerns that part of the digital humanities that makes use of data analytic techniques that go by the names 'data mining', 'machine learning' or 'pattern recognition.'
These techniques, while not exactly new and in many cases of long-standing provenance, animate and drive many of the most prominent data-intensive digital humanities projects. 
Following C.S. Peirce and F. Guattari, we can identify a diagrammatic component of the digital humanities. 
The diagrammatic takes several different semiotic forms in data analytic techniques: the data plot (histogram, scatterplot, line plot, network plot, etc.); the algebraic expression (the probability distribution; the error function, etc.) and the algorithm (sometimes expressed in pseudo-code, but more often than not in code written in `R`, `Python` or suchlike). 
These diagrams are at the heart of many different data-intensive knowledge enterprises (social media, predictive medicine, financial trading, government security, etc.), but in the digital humanities they come to bear on large collections of documents (literature) and images (photographs and videos). 
The diagrams are little discussed in their own right, even though they deeply animate many of the practices associated with the digital humanities.
Until we find ways of intensifying thinking around diagrammatic processes, digital humanities remains captive to the coding processes of existing abstract machines. 
The paper will suggest, through some discussion of diagrams relating to Principal Component Analysis, Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Naive Bayes how
